# Simple Bookstore MERN App Template

This repository is a template for building MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) applications. 

## Getting Started
To run the application, you'll need to start both the backend and the frontend servers.

### Backend

1. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
### Frontend

2. Open a new terminal and navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   
### Environment Variables

To connect to your MongoDB database, you'll need to set up an .env file in the server directory with the following variable:
```
MONGODB_URL=your-mongodb-url>
```
